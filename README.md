# Zyro

Turn a fresh Arch installation into a fully-configured, beautiful, and modern system based on Hyprland by running a single command. That's the one-line pitch for Zyro. No need to write bespoke configs for every essential tool just to get started or to be up on all the latest command-line tools. Zyro is an opinionated take on what Linux can be at its best.
